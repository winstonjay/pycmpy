Provide routines for input and output.

####Â USE
See notes per function for use parameters.

## Reading and writing (prog how to notes).

Both reading and writing can be done with systems calls.
To do this we use the "SoftWare Interupt" instruction
`SWI` with our registers set to the following parameters:

system read:
    R0 = input stream (stdin); R0 = 0
    R1 = buffer address to read into.
    R2 = number of characters to read.
    R7 = system call number; R7 = 3

system write:
    R0 = output stream (stdout); R0 = 1
    R1 = output string address
    R2 = output string length
    R7 = system call number; R7 = 4
*/
