to compile asm files
$ as -o add.o add.s
ld -o add add.o

# to echo R0
./add ; echo $?

see makefile for more stuff
# to compile for debugging add the following flag.

$ as -g -o <file.o> <file.s>
$ ld -o <file> <file.o>

once this has been compiled we can use the program in `gdb`

To start `gdb` run:
	$ gdb <file>

## in gdb

(gdb) disassemble _start		<- disassemble code in start section.
(gdb) b 20 				<- set breakpoint at line 20
(gdb) delete				<- delete all breakpoints
(gdb) run		<- run program if breakpoint it will stop at that point. 

(gdb) info r		<- show info stored in our registers
(gdb) continue		<- run till the next breakpoint

you can use continue etc untill the program finishes running then you can start again

(gdb) quit 		<- exit gdb

i have added a debugging option on our makefile to make it easier to debug.
